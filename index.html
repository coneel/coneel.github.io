						<h2>Asthma Patients in California</h2>
						<p>This is a project I did for my Modeling and Representation of Data class. 
							The data set is from a study to compare the quality of services provided by two physician groups for asthma patients in California. Specifically, 
							for patient i, let Yi(w) be the quality of service as judged by the patient (1=satisfactory, 0=not satisfactory), if the patient is served by physician group w, 
							for w=1,2. The patients who visit the two groups can differ, and so a set of covariates are measured.

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p><br>Growing up in Silicon Valley during the tech explosion, I’ve been baptized in the gospel of big data. Virtually every adult I knew growing up worked in either in the tech industry or a tech focused role - so most dinner table conversations or evenings spent with family friends revolved around the Tech world. I think because of this, that world has always excited me. However, I never really knew how I fit into it. Sure, I enjoyed some math like Statistics and Algebra (others like Calculus less so), and the few programming classes I took were interesting enough; but I had always viewed myself as more of the creative type. I enjoyed reading, writing and history, but these disciplines felt incompatible with the world of Tech. I didn't see myself as cutout for software engineering or any other type of engineering really, so I studied finance and business analytics in undergrad. It wasn’t until after graduation working at J.P. Morgan that I really heard about data science, and I knew it was exactly what I had been looking for. 

								<br><br>Data Science is the blend of math, coding, storytelling and critical thinking that sits at the intersection of all my academic interests. Once this light bulb in my brain went on I instantly began researching Data Science graduate programs and began preparing for the GRE. 
								
								<br><br>What I love about Duke’s program (in addition to the incredibly accessible and fantastic professors) is that the program emphasizes the aspects of data science such as study design, causal inference and storytelling in addition to all the crucial technical skills such as coding, machine learning, statistics and linear algebra. The technical skills are crucial, and I truly love learning them - but they are simply the tools you use. If you cannot understand what questions to ask, how to set up an effective experiment and what models most accurately deliver the answer to those questions, and how to effectively communicate those results you will not be an effective data scientist no matter how consummate your abilities in math and coding. 
								
								<br><br>Outside of school work I enjoy cooking, hiking, traveling, soccer, football and reading books on ancient European history. I’ll spare you some tenuous attempt to make an abstract connection these hobbies have to data science. Instead I’ll simply leave it at that and include some killer book recs and recipes below. I'm also addicted to power ranking things, so I’ll throw up a few of those as well - these rankings should be taken as definitive and not up for debate.
